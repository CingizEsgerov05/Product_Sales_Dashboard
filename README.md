# Product sales Dashboard

## Problem statement

The goal of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of product sales and performance across different categories and regions over time. The dashboard enables stakeholders to track and analyze key metrics such as total quantity sold, order percentages, monthly performance trends, and product profitability.

Key objectives:

 - Monitor sales performance over a selected date range by category, product, and region.

 - Identify top-selling and most profitable products to inform strategic decision-making and inventory planning.

 - Track monthly KPIs such as total orders, returns, and revenue against predefined goals.

 - Visualize geographical sales distribution to evaluate performance in different markets.

The second page of the dashboard provides detailed insights into individual products selected by the user, including trends, return rates, and other relevant metrics to support deeper analysis and decision-making at the product level.


## Data Preparation Summary
The data used for this dashboard was sourced from multiple Excel (.xlsx) files. A comprehensive data preparation process was carried out to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis in Power BI.

Key steps in data preparation included:

 - Data Loading: Sales and product-related data were imported from various Excel files into Power BI.

 - Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled, duplicate records were removed, and inconsistent data entries were corrected to ensure data quality.

 - Data Transformation: Column data types were adjusted, and necessary formatting changes were applied to make the data suitable for reporting.

 - Calculated Columns: Several calculated columns were created to derive new attributes such as order percentages, product categories, and custom labels for easier analysis.

 - DAX Measures: Custom DAX measures were developed to calculate key metrics such as total orders, monthly returns, revenue, and goal comparisons.

 - Filtering and Aggregation: Appropriate filters, slicers, and data hierarchies were applied to allow interactive analysis by region, category, and product.

 - Data Modeling: Relationships were established between tables to enable accurate and dynamic cross-filtering across visuals.

This structured approach ensured the dataset was clean, reliable, and well-suited for building insightful and interactive visualizations across different levels of detail.
